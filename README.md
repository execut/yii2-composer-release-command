# Yii2 command for fast releasing and versioning composer packages
This command can publish and calculate the version of the set of packages in your project at a one fast and simple run:
```./yii release```

## Installation

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

$ php composer.phar require execut/yii2-composer-release-command "dev-master"
```

or add

```

to the ```require``` section of your `composer.json` file.

```php
[
    'controllerMap' => [
        'release' => [
            'class' => \execut\release\ReleaseController::class,
            'vendorFolder' => 'execut', // Folder(s) inside @vendor for releasing, supported list 
        ],
    ],
